# AI Image Generator 🚀

A fun web app that turns your text ideas—like "sunset beach" or "cute robot"—into cool AI-generated images right in your browser. Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

## ✨ Features
- **Real-time AI Generation**: Type a prompt → hit Generate → watch magic happen
- **Smooth UX**: "Generating..." loading states + friendly error messages
- **Fully Responsive**: Looks great on phones, tablets, desktops
- **Zero Setup**: No accounts, API keys, or servers needed—just open & play!

## 🛠 Tech Stack
