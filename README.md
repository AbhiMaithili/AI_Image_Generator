# AI_Image_Generator
AI Image Generator is a fun little web app that takes your text ideas—like "sunset beach" or "cute robot"—and turns them into awesome AI-generated images right in your browser. I built it from scratch using just HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript, connecting to a free text-to-image AI service (Puter.ai) that spits out pictures on the spot.
